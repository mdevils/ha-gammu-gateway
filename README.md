## 🚀 Introduction
This custom integration allows **Home Assistant** to communicate with a local SMS Gateway based on Gammu. It connects to the REST API provided by the **SMS Gammu Gateway** software to monitor signal strength, network status, send SMS messages, and receive incoming SMS via polling.

It is designed to be fully configurable via the Home Assistant UI.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites
**IMPORTANT**: This integration **is not standalone**. It requires the **SMS Gammu Gateway** software to be installed and running on a device in your network (e.g., via Docker or directly on a Raspberry Pi with a USB modem).

You **must** have this software running first:
👉 **[pajikos/sms-gammu-gateway on GitHub](https://github.com/pajikos/sms-gammu-gateway)**

Ensure that:
1. The gateway is reachable via IP address.
2. The REST API is active (usually on port 5000).
3. You have the `username` and `password` configured in the gateway (Defaults: `admin`/`password`).

## ✨ Features
- **Signal Monitoring**: Real-time sensor for signal strength (dBm).
- **Network Info**: Sensors for Network Operator, Network State, and Network Code.
- **Send SMS**: A dedicated service (`gammu_gateway.send_sms`) to send text messages from HA.
- **Receive SMS**: Polls the gateway for new messages, stores them, and fires a Home Assistant event (`gammu_gateway_sms_received`).
- **Message history**: A persisted list of received/sent messages, exposed via the `SMS Messages` sensor and manageable with the `clear_messages` / `delete_message` services.
- **Lovelace cards**: Two ready-to-use dashboard cards — a **Send SMS** form and a **SMS Messages** list — auto-registered, no manual resource setup.
- **Modem Control**: A dedicated button entity to **Reset** the modem remotely.
- **Configurable Intervals**: Set independent update intervals for Signal/Network data and SMS checking.
- **UI Configuration**: Fully managed via Config Flow (Settings -> Devices & Services), including a **re-authentication** flow when credentials change.

## 🖥 Lovelace cards
The integration ships two dependency-free custom cards that are registered
automatically (no need to add a Lovelace resource manually).

**Send SMS** — add a card of type `gammu-send-card`:

```yaml
type: custom:gammu-send-card
title: Send SMS          # optional
default_number: "+1555…" # optional
```

**Messages list** — add a card of type `gammu-messages-card`, pointing it at the
`SMS Messages` sensor created by the integration:

```yaml
type: custom:gammu-messages-card
entity: sensor.sms_messages   # adjust to your actual entity id
title: SMS Messages           # optional
limit: 10                     # optional: show only the newest N messages
```

Both cards are also available from the dashboard **"Add card"** picker
(search for "Gammu"). If a card doesn't appear right after installing/updating,
hard-refresh the browser to clear the cached JavaScript.

## 🧰 Services
| Service | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `gammu_gateway.send_sms` | Send an SMS. Fields: `number`, `message`, optional `smsc`. |
| `gammu_gateway.clear_messages` | Remove all messages from the stored history. |
| `gammu_gateway.delete_message` | Remove a single message by `message_id` (from the sensor attributes). |

## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Install via HACS (Recommended)
1. Open Home Assistant and ensure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Go to **HACS** → **Integrations** → **Top Right Menu** → **Custom Repositories**.
3. Enter the URL of this repository.
4. Select **Integration** as the category and click **Add**.
5. Click **Install** and restart Home Assistant.
6. Navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → Search for **SMS Gammu Gateway**.

### 2️⃣ Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `custom_components/gammu_gateway` folder into your Home Assistant's `config/custom_components/` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration via **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → Search for **SMS Gammu Gateway**.

## ⚙️ Configuration
During the setup via UI, you will be asked for:
* **Host**: The IP address of the machine running `sms-gammu-gateway`.
* **Port**: The API port (Default: `5000`).
* **Username**: API Username (Default: `admin`).
* **Password**: API Password (Default: `password`).
* **Signal Scan Interval**: How often to update signal/network sensors (in seconds).
* **SMS Check Interval**: How often to poll for new messages (minimum 10 seconds).

## 📖 Usage

### Sending SMS
You can use the `gammu_gateway.send_sms` service in your scripts or automations:

```yaml
service: gammu_gateway.send_sms
data:
  number: "+393331234567"
  message: "Alert! The alarm has been triggered."
```

### Receiving SMS (Automation)
The integration fires an event when a new SMS is detected. You can catch this event in an automation:

```yaml
alias: "Notify on SMS Received"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: gammu_gateway_sms_received
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
    data:
      title: "New SMS from {{ trigger.event.data.sender }}"
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.text }}"
```

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### `GET /getsms … 401` in the gateway logs
The gateway leaves `/signal`, `/network` and `/reset` **unauthenticated**, but
`/sms` and `/getsms` **require** HTTP Basic auth. Because the sensors only use
the unauthenticated endpoints, a wrong username/password used to be accepted
silently and only surfaced as a `401` on every `/getsms` poll.

This fork now:
1. Validates the credentials against the authenticated `/sms` endpoint during
   setup, so a bad username/password fails immediately with *"Invalid username
   or password"* instead of being accepted.
2. Triggers a **re-authentication** prompt (Settings → Devices & Services) if
   the gateway starts rejecting the stored credentials.

If you still see `401`, open the integration and re-enter the username/password
so they match the `username`/`password` configured in the SMS Gammu Gateway
add-on/server.
